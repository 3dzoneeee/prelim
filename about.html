          <p>
            <br>I am Edson Jay A. Malazar. I live in  Bliss Village , City of Ilagan Isabela. April 29, 2002 is the day I was born. I'm 20 years old right now. Both my mother and father are from the Camarines Sur province. Both of them
            resided in the Bicol region, but we are currently in Isabela. Although we don't have any relatives here, we are quite good at interacting with others. Bicol language is the mother tongue of our parents. We can now understand languages like
            Ilocano and Ibanag because we reside here. Although we can understand those languages, speaking them is really challenging for us. I am the second of three siblings to be born. My youngest brother is 12 years old, and my older brother is 24
            years old.
          <p>
            <br />
          <p>I am an approachable, easy to get along with person who values kindness, respect, motivation, confidence, and self-discipline. I can also be a little bit lucky at times. I have a lot of friends I can trust. We often have fun together, and
            when we do run into an issue, we always figure it out together. When I'm with them, I sometimes go wild and crazy. Every time they see me, my friends comment on how cheerful I always seem to be. I always grin since it's one of my best
            qualities. Their happy pill is me. When projects take longer than expected, I become frustrated while studying. One of my faults is that I might be unconfident at times.<br>
            <br>
          <p>When I have free time in the afternoon, my friends and I like to play basketball. playing online games like Call of Duty, Mobile Legends, etc. Every Thursday and Sunday, I enjoy going to church to pray and give thanks to the Lord for all
            the
            blessings he bestows upon our family. I enjoy reading manga and manhua as well as watching anime. Because of the storyline and Luffy's adventures as the main character, One Piece is my favorite anime. Black is my favorite color, and I adore
            sporting black t-shirts. I enjoy reading a few books as well. I especially enjoy learning about math, science, English, and Filipino.<br>
            <br>
          <p>I am committed to pursuing my goals, no matter how challenging they may be. Making my parents pleased and achieving financial stability are two of my goals. I wish my parents could witness my future success. I constantly ask God to grant
            our
            family a strong and healthy body. Everything happens for a reason is my life's motto. Always be optimistic and keep your dreams in mind. Whatever happens, I can always rely on my family and friends. And I give God praise for bringing them
            into my life.<br>
